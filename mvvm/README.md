# 🧱 Flutter MVVM Architecture with Provider

A scalable and well-organized Flutter project using **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture and `Provider` for state management. This structure supports separation of concerns, clean code practices, and easy maintainability.

## 📁 Folder Descriptions

### 🔸 `const/`
Contains constants used across the app such as:
- Colors (`app_colors.dart`)
- Image paths (`app_images.dart`)
- String literals (`app_strings.dart`)

**✅ Why?** Keeps your app consistent and makes global changes easier.

---

### 🔸 `model/`
Holds data models for APIs or local data structures, e.g., `UserModel`, `ProductModel`.

**✅ Why?** Represents structured data in Dart for easy parsing and validation.

---

### 🔸 `provider/` *(ViewModel Layer)*
Includes `ChangeNotifier` classes that manage state and logic for views. Acts as the **ViewModel** in MVVM.

**✅ Why?** Separates UI from business logic and exposes reactive state to widgets.

---

### 🔸 `services/`
Handles communication with external APIs, databases, or platform-specific code.

**✅ Why?** Keeps network or storage logic separate from UI and business logic.

---

### 🔸 `utils/`
Utility/helper functions that can be reused globally, like formatters, validators, converters, etc.

**✅ Why?** Prevents code duplication and improves reusability.

---

### 🔸 `view/`
Holds all UI screens (Views). Each screen may have its own folder if complex. Also contains shared UI components.

**✅ Why?** Keeps UI code organized and modular. Encourages reuse and better structure.

## 🧠 Why MVVM?

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) separates concerns into three clear layers:

| Layer       | Role |
|-------------|------|
| **Model**   | Represents data (e.g., API responses) |
| **View**    | UI layer that listens to ViewModel |
| **ViewModel (Provider)** | Handles business logic and exposes data to the view |

This pattern improves:
- Testability
- Readability
- Maintainability
- Scalability

## 🧪 Example Flow

1. **View** subscribes to a `UserProvider`
2. **UserProvider** fetches data using `UserService`
3. `UserService` makes an API call and returns a `UserModel`
4. `UserProvider` notifies the view to rebuild using `notifyListeners()`

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
